# MAL Management JS

> Note: This repo is still in work on progress. 

At first with the roll out of new MAL v2 api, I just want to play around th api itself however I find it inconvenient to do different call to each of items I needed off the api. 

Inspired from contentful-management-js, this codebase aims to have a chainable, easy to use api wrapper for MAL API.
